# Happy-Meter
This Happy-Meter project is made by me and 2 other teammates during Hack Davis 2020 event. We were inspired by the use of Snapchat or Instagram Stories by people to take the selfie of their presence during their happy time, sad, or even in the time of danger. We personally think that this app function could be an important extension for Snapchat or Instagram stories to address the most important issue we are handling - mental health issue.
## Elevator-Pitch:
Isolation in one of the major concerns in this era, what if we made an app to extend a hand to those who are too afraid to reach out for help.
## Inspiration:
By Snapchat and Instagram stories where people showcase their times of happiness, sadness, or sometimes even times of danger. In the United States, almost half of adults experienced a mental illness during their lifetime, initially caused by depression.
## What it does:
It is an Android app using Google Cloud’s vision API. The app can take a picture from the phone’s camera of a person’s face and can detect the happiness level of the face. From here the app takes you to a second screen where the app displays the happiness level of the face picture taken (in percentage %) and a quote corresponding to the happiness level.
When the face is detected to be sad, the app can help to provide the quotes to encourage them. When the face is detected to be happy, the app can still give cheerful quotes. When the face is detected to be below 20% happy, the app can directly provide the phone hotline to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.
## How we built it:
We build this app using Java in Android Studio, with the help of Android Vision API.
