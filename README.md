# Happy-Meter
This Happy-Meter project is made by me and 2 other teammates during HackDavis 2020.

## What it does:
It is an Android app that leverages Google Cloud’s vision API. The app is able to utilize the device’s front or rear camera to take a picture of a person’s face. From here, the app can detect the happiness level of that person from the picture taken. Then, the app takes you to a second screen where the app displays the happiness level of the face picture taken (in percentage %) and an inspirational quote corresponding to the happiness level.
When the face is detected to be sad, the app can help to provide inspirational quotes to encourage them. 
When the face is detected to be happy, the app can still give cheerful quotes. 
When the face is detected to be below 20% happy, the app can directly provide the phone hotline to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

## How we built it:
We build this app using Java in Android Studio, with the help of Google Vision API.
